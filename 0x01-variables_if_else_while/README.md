# 0x01-variables_if_else_while.  :yum:

A series of exercises put on by the Holberton Academy are shown, where the first eleven exercises are called mandatory and the following are called advanced. (**A little harder than the previous ones**).

The exercises that were performed, all of them were done with a **_single loop_** and a **_single putchar_** function. It should also be noted that there was very little documentation in the programs since, due to the requirement of the betty style, it does not allow having more than 50 lines of code in a function, but it is about making the ***"code as clean"*** as possible.

***note: In exercise 100-print comb3.c, symbolic constants were used for a better reading of the program, since it is a bad practice to bury numbers. Since each project is trying to make code cleaner and more efficient.*** :rocket:

### requirements üìã

The code is compiled with the ```gcc 4.8.4``` compiler using the ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra``` and ```-pedantic``` flags, therefore to get the executable file use the following command.

> gcc Filename

or for the second command.

> gcc Filename -o executable-file-name

The first command gives us an executable with the name of ```a.out``` and the second with the name of ```executable-file-name```, to run the program use the following command.

> ./a.out

or for the second command.

> ./executable-file-name

### example :metal:

Exercise ```9-print comb.c``` was compiled, for this, keyboards the following.

> gcc 9-print comb.c

Next, we execute the code.

> ./ a.out

which gives us the following output.

> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

***Note: The most interesting is the following if, if we are in a terminal and execute the following code.***

> /9-print_comb | cat -e | less

it is appreciated that a dollar sign appears, this means that there are no space characters (tab), at the end of the character '9' the program executes a line break.

> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$

## About the exercises.
In the previous project I did not show the exercises that were in the repository, at a certain point I do not see it as prudent, but for people who see it and possibly clone it, it would be good for them to know these exercises for their possible resolution.

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing mandatory 
 
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

    You can find the source code here
    The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
    You don‚Äôt have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
        The number, followed by
            if the number is greater than 0: is positive
            if the number is 0: is zero
            if the number is less than 0: is negative
        followed by a new line
        
 1. The last digit 

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

    You can find the source code here

    You don‚Äôt have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
        The string Last digit of, followed by
        n, followed by
        the string is, followed by
            if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
            if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
