# 0x01-variables_if_else_while.  :yum:

A series of exercises put on by the Holberton Academy are shown, where the first eleven exercises are called mandatory and the following are called advanced. (**A little harder than the previous ones**).

The exercises that were performed, all of them were done with a **_single loop_** and a **_single putchar_** function. It should also be noted that there was very little documentation in the programs since, due to the requirement of the betty style, it does not allow having more than 50 lines of code in a function, but it is about making the ***"code as clean"*** as possible.

### requirements 📋

The code is compiled with the ```gcc 4.8.4``` compiler using the ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra``` and ```-pedantic``` flags, therefore to get the executable file use the following command.

> gcc Filename

or for the second command.

> gcc Filename -o executable-file-name

The first command gives us an executable with the name of ```a.out``` and the second with the name of ```executable-file-name```, to run the program use the following command.

> ./a.out

or for the second command.

> ./executable-file-name

### example :metal:

Exercise ```9-print comb.c``` was compiled, for this, keyboards the following.

> gcc 9-print comb.c

Next, we execute the code.

> ./ a.out

which gives us the following output.

> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

***Note: The most interesting is the following if, if we are in a terminal and execute the following code.***

> /9-print_comb | cat -e | less

it is appreciated that a dollar sign appears, this means that there are no space characters (tab), at the end of the character '9' the program executes a line break.
