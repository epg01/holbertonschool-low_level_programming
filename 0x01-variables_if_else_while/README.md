# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

A series of exercises put on by the Holberton Academy are shown, where the first eleven exercises are called mandatory and the following are called advanced. (**A little harder than the previous ones**).

The exercises that were performed, all of them were done with a **_single loop_** and a **_single putchar_** function. It should also be noted that there was very little documentation in the programs since, due to the requirement of the betty style, it does not allow having more than 50 lines of code in a function, but it is about making the ***"code as clean"*** as possible.

### Pre-requisitos ðŸ“‹

The code is compiled with the ```gcc 4.8.4``` compiler using the ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra``` and ```-pedantic``` flags, therefore to get the executable file use the following command.

> gcc Filename

o

> gcc Filename -o executable-file-name
